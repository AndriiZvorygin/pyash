# Pyac VLIW semantic slices

The normative encoding and execution boundary is
`documentation/specifications/27-pyash-vliw-isa.md`. This reference records the
currently proven semantic slices and their fixtures.

## Numeric plus

The first executable slice uses:

```pyash
ob num 1 to num 1 be plus do
```

The JavaScript reference backend accepts unsigned 16-bit `ob num A to num B`
plus, preserving the legacy instrumental and accusative operands. Numeric plus
saturates at `0xFFFF`, subtract floors at zero, divide returns the integer
quotient, and divide by zero is an explicit execution error.

The fixed 16-word codelet has this nine-word prefix:

```text
0149 881D A 287E 881D B 245E 8A64 295E
```

Seven zero words complete the vector. The decoder validates markers, numeric
quote fields, and the zero tail before returning the canonical sentence. The
reference implementation is `program/library/vliw/plus.mjs`; its fixture is
`examples/pyash/vliw-numeric-plus.pya`, with conformance in
`quiz/vliw_plus_semantics.test.mjs`.

## Quote descriptors and surface rendering

The legacy quote-denote is `0x001D`, with `0x881D` numeric, `0x081D` letter,
and `0x0E1D` paragraph-letter classes. `decodeQuoteHeader` exposes region,
pointed, sequence, vector-width, scalar-width, and sort fields. Numeric and
letter quotes consume one 16-bit payload; paragraph-letter quotes consume an
explicit length and character words.

Quote markers describe value representation. Lexical Pyash spellings remain HNUC
table entries; the shared decoder combines typed values with case markers. The
plus golden vector renders as `hyikdoyu hyikdoka plustu`, while its canonical
semantic form remains `ob num 1 to num 1 be plus do`.

The decoder accepts unsigned numeric, single-character, and paragraph-letter
payloads. Surface number rendering currently covers legacy zero through twenty;
larger numbers remain structured until compound surface composition is added.

## Generic fixed-slot decoding

`program/library/vliw/codelets.mjs` losslessly decodes the existing 16-word slot,
delegating quote words to the shared decoder and resolving known lexical words
through HNUC. Unknown non-quote words remain raw. The first standalone zero marks
the used boundary and all following slots must be zero. `renderLegacyCodelet`
preserves raw words and supported typed values without claiming arbitrary codelets
are executable.

`program/library/vliw/word_code.mjs` ports lwonprom's
`neo_word_code_encode` shape: glyph length and placement select word class, then
consonant, vowel, tone, and final-consonant fields are packed. The inverse decodes
to Pyac. `pyashWords.json` supplies vocabulary membership and English glosses,
not HNUC calculation. Phrase codelets use this through `phrase.mjs`.

## Typed literals

The second slice covers:

```pyash
ob num 7 be number ya
ob text "A" be text ya
```

The five-word prefixes are:

```text
0019 881D value 245E 217E
0019 081D code-unit 245E 217E
```

Numeric values use unsigned 16-bit payloads; letters use one UTF-16 code unit;
paragraph letters use an explicit length and bounded UTF-16 payload. Decoding
returns the canonical `ya` sentence and execution returns the same typed fact.
The implementation is `literal.mjs`, with fixtures
`vliw-typed-literals.pya` and `vliw-extended-values.pya` and quizzes
`vliw_literal_semantics.test.mjs` and `vliw_extended_values.test.mjs`.

## Named scalar facts

Named facts use the legacy index, name, nominative case, typed quote/payload,
accusative case, and realis mood:

```text
0065 name 24DE 881D value 245E 217E
0065 name 24DE 081D code-unit 245E 217E
```

`named_literal.mjs` supports one or more legacy vocabulary words per name,
unsigned numeric values, and bounded paragraph-letter text. Unknown names, wider
text, and unsupported quote widths retain explicit rejection reasons. The runnable
fixture is `examples/pyash/vliw-named-literals.pya`.

`buildVliwDatabaseFromTranslation(lines, options)` resolves an existing
translation adapter, preserves one source record per translated sentence, and
passes canonical sentences through catalog, pack, query, and replay contracts.
Records retain language, locator, line index, sentence index, and original text.

## Reference facade

`program/library/vliw/index.mjs` exposes:

- `lowerSentence(sentence)` and `lowerParagraph(paragraph)`;
- `decodeCodelet(words)`;
- `executeCodelets(codelets)`; and
- `scheduleCodeletDependencies(instructions)`, which rejects unresolved
  references and duplicate writers.

The proven facade supports numeric `plus`, scalar `subtract`, `multiply`,
`divide`, and `xor`; anonymous and named numeric/text/boolean literals;
multiword legacy names; and bounded paragraph-letter text. Valid but unknown
codelets decode losslessly and are then rejected explicitly. Vector and date
values remain unsupported catalog rows until their exact legacy layouts have
golden fixtures.
